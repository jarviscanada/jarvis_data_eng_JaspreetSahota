**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JaspreetSahota/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JaspreetSahota/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent using Bash to track CPU, memory, and disk usage across multiple Linux nodes, storing data in a PostgreSQL database. Implemented containerization with Docker, automation via crontab, and version control through Git, ensuring scalable performance monitoring. Tested scripts using psql and manual validation to verify accurate data collection and reliability. Deployed the solution in a Dockerized environment for consistent and automated system monitoring.


## Highlighted Projects
**LocaLens: A Tourist Recommender System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/AnthonyOlijnyk/localens)]: Developed a social-network-based tourist recommender system in Python and React.js featuring a monolithic REST architecture; implemented machine learning models using Random Forest for non-real-time predictions and reinforcement learning with web scraping for real-time updates; tested with Postman and PyTest and deployed on a publicly accessible web platform.
